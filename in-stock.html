                <p>Wild hyacinth: This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil
                    high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open
                    meadows
                    or prairies. Additionally, it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be
                    divided in
                    autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally, the
                    plant
                    spreads by seed rather than by runners.</p>

                <p>Lily-of-the-Valley: With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright
                    emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an
                    old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly,
                    and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in
                    bounds. Tolerates shade well. <strong>Warning: This plant is poisonous,</strong></p>

                <p>Crown Imperials: Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, making rapid growth in the
                    spring, flowering during April/early May and dying down in the summer. Best in raised beds or
                    planters. Does not tolerate shade; needs a warm sunny position where it can be left undisturbed for
                    many years.</p>

                <p>Persian Buttercup: This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet tall and has large showy blloms in
                    a variety of colors from May to June. Persian buttercups are most commonly grown from tubers planted
                    in the beginning of spring. Each plant will produce up to 70 blooms in a season. Good for cooler
                    weather; can tolerate light frost.</p>

                <p>Spring starflower: These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form
                    dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall
                    planted bulbs. They can get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread. Each bulb will produce
                    numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star-shaped
                    with six blue or white pearls.</p>

                    before a hard frost is expected and when soils are below 60 degrees F.</p>
